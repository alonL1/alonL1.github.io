## About Me
I’m an Informatics major at the University of Washington with a technical focus on server-side programming, web development, and machine learning. I enjoy the puzzle of debugging and love the moment when a complex system finally clicks. My approach to server-side development is methodical: I start with clear data models, design APIs that scale, and test edge cases early so the system stays reliable as features grow.

Outside the lab, I keep things balanced. I’m into bowling (and always tweaking my form), I ski when I can, and I spend quality time with my dog. These hobbies keep me grounded, curious, and energized—qualities I bring back into my work when collaborating and building for real users.

## Projects

### Bowling Tracker App (React + Node.js)
A stats-focused web app for the two-handed bowling community. Users track games, analyze performance trends, and compare series over time. The app is designed for deployment on a cloud platform with an eye toward future monetization through premium analytics features and community tools.

### Guess That Bit
A game where players guess video clips from short audio snippets. I built the logic for random clip selection, timing, and scoring to keep the experience engaging and replayable. The focus is on clean game flow, low friction onboarding, and social sharing to drive retention.

### Additional Example Projects
- **Campus Queue Optimizer:** A mock service that predicts peak times for dining halls and recommends the shortest lines using historical data.
- **Study Sprint Planner:** A productivity tool that creates timed study sessions with goals, reminders, and progress snapshots.
- **Volunteer Match Hub:** A concept platform that matches volunteers to local opportunities based on skills, availability, and causes.
